/**
 * Seed the decision ledger from seed/seed-decisions.json when the ledger is
 * empty (e.g. a fresh MongoDB database, or a cloud runner with no cached
 * consensus.db). Idempotent against whatever backend is active (MongoDB when
 * MONGODB_URI is set, else SQLite/JSON): it skips entirely when the ledger
 * already has any rows, and addDecision itself ignores duplicates on
 * (channel_id, message_ts, statement).
 *
 * The ledger API is async (the MongoDB driver is async), so this uses top-level
 * await and an explicit process.exit so an open MongoDB connection can't keep
 * the child process (spawned by start-render.mjs) alive.
