</div>

**Catch it before it ships wrong.** Consensus is an ambient consistency layer for Slack — a contradiction firewall for organizational memory. It notices when your team makes a decision, remembers it with full provenance, and catches anyone about to contradict it — live, across channels, permission-aware — before the mistake ships.

Built for the **Slack Agent Builder Challenge 2026** (Track 1: Best New Slack Agent).

## What it does

- **Ambient decision capture** — no slash commands. An LLM classifier spots settled decisions in normal conversation ("we're standardizing on Postgres") and files them in a Decision Ledger with statement, rationale, decider, timestamp, and permalink. Handles meeting-notes dumps too: one message containing several decisions yields several ledger entries, and "What we decided: …" recap phrasing is captured as well.
- **Live contradiction detection** — messages are checked against active decisions by a scope-aware LLM judge. Catches casual-language contradictions ("lets just spin up MongoDB") with **no keyword dependence**, and warns the author with a private, ephemeral alert: receipt, confidence, and *This is intentional — supersede / Not a conflict / Show reasoning* buttons.
- **Permission-aware by construction** — if the conflicting decision lives in a private channel the author can't see, the alert is **redacted**: the conflict is flagged, but no statement, channel, or link is revealed. Membership checked per alert, fail-closed. The App Home decision log is permission-filtered per viewer too.
- **Provenance on demand** — ask `@Consensus why did we choose Postgres?` and get the real ledger entry with the original thread as proof, augmented by Slack's **Real-Time Search API** on the local per-user-OAuth path (`[ledger]` vs `[live search]` results are never conflated).
- **Edit-sync & delete-retirement** — edit a captured message and Consensus reconciles the ledger (keep / retire / add) with a quiet "✏️ ledger synced" note; delete a decision and it's retired, so no ghost rule keeps firing.
- **It learns** — every *Not a conflict* becomes persistent false-positive memory; precision is tracked on the App Home dashboard.
- **Consistency audit** — on demand, Consensus scans your standing decisions (up to the 60 most recent) in a two-stage sweep (LLM scan → verification by the measured judge, bidirectional) and surfaces latent contradictions — pairs of decisions that already conflict without anyone noticing. Permission-filtered per viewer, DM'd from App Home; run in a channel it reports public-decision conflicts only.

## Try it in 3 minutes

_Judges: it's live in our sandbox, and nothing below is scripted. (Self-hosting? The same steps work once your instance is running.)_

1. **Capture** — post in any channel: `Decision: all demo scripts must be reviewed before recording.` → a 📌 **Decision captured** card appears in-thread (~15s).
2. **Contradict it — from a different channel** — in `#random`, casually type: `gonna record the new demo without review, no time` → you get a *private* ⚠️ alert quoting the original decision, with a confidence score and **Show reasoning · Not a conflict · This is intentional**.
3. **Teach it** — click **Not a conflict** on any alert → Consensus remembers and won't flag that pairing again.
4. **Ask for provenance** — `@Consensus what have we decided about databases?` → a grounded answer with permalinks (ledger + live Real-Time Search).
5. **Open the dashboard** — Consensus in the sidebar → **Home** tab → the permission-filtered decision log, alerts fired, and tracked precision.

> **The showpiece — permission redaction.** Decisions from a _private_ channel are guarded too, but an alert about one is **redacted for non-members** — no statement, no channel, no link. Ask about a decision from a channel you're not a member of, and Consensus refuses. Permission-aware, fail-closed.

## Measured, not claimed

The contradiction judge ships with an eval harness — **58 hand-labeled cases** including scope-different near-misses, sarcasm, hypotheticals, negation traps, and **9 adversarial prompt-injection attacks** (including Unicode-homoglyph, HTML-entity, and zero-width/RTL-override delimiter-break attempts):

```
Cerebras gemma (fallback)         58/58 · Precision 1.000 · Recall 1.000
Cerebras GLM-4.7 (hosted brain)   57/58 · Precision 1.000 · Recall 0.964  (one expired-freeze time-scoping case)
Claude (local dev, Agent SDK)     56/58 · Precision 0.964 · Recall 0.964  (same time-scoping case + one FP)
0 hard-fails on all three · 9/9 adversarial injections defeated on every stack
```

Receipts committed for every stack — hosted [`EVAL-RESULTS-hosted.txt`](consensus-core/eval/EVAL-RESULTS-hosted.txt), gemma [`EVAL-RESULTS-hosted-gemma.txt`](consensus-core/eval/EVAL-RESULTS-hosted-gemma.txt), local Claude [`EVAL-RESULTS.txt`](consensus-core/eval/EVAL-RESULTS.txt) — same prompts throughout. The harness hard-fails on LLM errors (parse failures count as hard errors, with one transient retry, so a dead model can never score) and reports precision as UNDEFINED with zero predicted positives. Run it: `npm run eval`.

The scores are high because the judge is good, not because the test is soft — read the cases yourself in [`consensus-core/eval/dataset.js`](consensus-core/eval/dataset.js): 20 near-misses (same technology different scope, agreeing negations, expired time windows, superseded decisions, sarcasm) sit alongside the 9 injection attacks, all chosen to *break* a naive matcher. Untrusted content is NFKC-normalized before delimiter-wrapping, so none of the payloads flip the verdict. A keyword bot fails these; the scope-aware judge doesn't.

## Required technologies (all three)

- **Real-Time Search API** (`assistant.search.context`) — live workspace search in **both paths**: the hosted brain augments provenance answers with live public-channel search (public-only by construction — the token is the app owner's, so restricting to workspace-public content makes it leak-proof for any asker), and the local per-user-OAuth path searches the full permission-aware `search:read.*` scope as the requesting user (demoed in the video).
- **Slack MCP Server** — powers the agent's Slack tool-use (search / read / write) in the conversational path, where the Claude Agent SDK runs a real multi-turn tool loop over the MCP tools (load-bearing there; shown in the video). The hosted cloud brain is a single-shot completion with no tool loop by design, so it grounds on the ledger + live RTS instead.
- **Slack AI / Agent & Assistant surface** — conversational provenance Q&A (both paths)

Key modules — all in [`consensus-core/`](consensus-core/):

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `pipeline.js` | Ambient brain: pre-filter, capture, contradiction check, alerting |
| `judge.js` | LLM classifier + scope-aware contradiction judge, injection-hardened (`<untrusted_*>` wrapping) |
| `ledger.js` | Decision ledger + dismissal memory + event log — **MongoDB** (durable, hosted) when `MONGODB_URI` is set, SQLite (WAL) / JSON fallback locally |
| `permissions.js` | Fail-closed membership gate with 5-min cache |
| `blocks.js` | Block Kit surfaces (cards, alerts, App Home) with mrkdwn sanitization |
| `rts.js` | Real-Time Search wrapper (fail-open, 3s timeout) |
| `eval/` | Dataset + harness + recorded results |

## Run it

```sh
npm install
slack run          # installs to your sandbox and starts via Socket Mode
```

Requires the [Slack CLI](https://tools.slack.dev/slack-cli/) and a [developer sandbox](https://api.slack.com/developer-program). **Dual model stack:** local dev runs Claude via the Claude Agent SDK; the hosted deployment runs **Cerebras GLM-4.7** (`CEREBRAS_API_KEY`), with a gemma / `GEMINI_API_KEY` fallback. For Real-Time Search, complete the per-user OAuth flow via `node app-oauth.js`. Full self-host and deploy steps are below.

### Self-host it — bring your own keys

Consensus is fully self-hostable — nothing is locked to a vendor, and there's no marketplace listing to wait on. Any team can stand up its own private instance in ~20 minutes:

1. **Clone & install** — clone the repo, then `cd claude-agent-sdk && npm install`.
2. **Create your Slack app** — from the included [`manifest.json`](manifest.json) (Slack CLI `slack create`, or [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → *Create New App → From a manifest*). Turn on **Socket Mode**.
3. **Get two tokens** — the **Bot token** (`xoxb-…`, from *OAuth & Permissions*) and an **App-level token** (`xapp-…`, scope `connections:write`, from *Basic Information → App-Level Tokens*).
4. **Bring your own keys** — set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, and **your own** model key: `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` (default, `zai-glm-4.7`) **or** `GEMINI_API_KEY` **or** local Claude via the Agent SDK — the chain in `consensus-core/llm.js` picks whichever is present. Set `MONGODB_URI` for durable storage, or omit it to fall back to a local `node:sqlite` / JSON file (no external service needed just to try it).
5. **Run it** — `node app.js` locally, or deploy the included [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) to [Render](https://render.com) (how our 24/7 instance runs). Then invite the bot to the channels you want it to guard.

Your instance runs entirely on **your keys, your workspace, your data** — nothing routes through us. A **one-click install + admin dashboard** (zero developer setup) is the [next item on our roadmap](#roadmap).

## Trust & safety design

- Ephemeral-first alerts — nobody is called out publicly
- Consent-first: the bot introduces itself on channel join; remove it to opt out
- Human-in-the-loop: the agent proposes, people confirm; it never silently rewrites the record
- Prompt-injection hardened: untrusted content is delimiter-wrapped and framed as data on every untrusted surface; measured against 9 adversarial injection patterns (all defeated on every model stack)
- Private-channel decision content never leaks: per-alert and per-viewer membership checks, unknown privacy treated as private. (App Home shows only workspace-wide *aggregate* counters — alerts fired, precision — never private decision content, and labeled as workspace-wide.)
- Hardened by adversarial review: earlier multi-model hostile passes (GPT, Gemini, and a GPT-Codex code+claims audit) were triaged — real findings fixed and remaining limitations documented openly, not claimed away — including audience-gated provenance (channel replies cite public decisions only; DMs are membership-gated), per-user sessions, precise claim scoping, and rate + queue + audit metering
- Trust model is "members are colleagues" (company workspaces, not open-invite communities): anyone can state a decision and anyone can correct the ledger — but every action is public, attributed, and event-logged, so manipulation is visible and reversible rather than silently prevented. Abuse blunting is built in: per-user dismissal memory (nobody can silence alerts for anyone else), a per-author daily capture cap (ledger flooding is throttled), and per-user/global rate guards. Full raid-resistant admin controls (member-tenure gating, role-gated corrections) are roadmap

## Roadmap

- **Admin control dashboard + one-click install** — an install-to-org OAuth flow and a self-serve config surface to opt channels in/out, tune sensitivity, and manage permissions in one place, so any team can roll Consensus out in a click.
- **Windowed dashboard stats** (7 / 30-day) — the schema is already there.
- **Member-tenure gating & role-gated corrections** for open-invite communities.
- **Deeper permission-aware search** and cross-message decision stitching.
